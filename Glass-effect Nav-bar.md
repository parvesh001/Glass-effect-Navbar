# Glass-effect-Navbar
Nowadays, Glass-effect is in trending. People are liking this effect and they seems to be more attractive with the websites using glass-effect styling. 

### HOW TO CREATE GLASS-EFFECT ###
To create glass-effect the background of concerned element must be transparent. To create a transparent background, using "hsl" to set the value of background property is recommended. for example, "background: hsl(0 0% 100% /.1)".
After setting background as transparent, one have to give it blur effect with "backdrop-filter" property. for example, "backdrop-filter: blur(.2rem)".
As soon as both the things are done, one will get a glass-effect.
